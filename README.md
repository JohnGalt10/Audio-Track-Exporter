# Audio-Track-Exporter
An addon for Blender that exports each VSE channel containing audio strips as individual audio files to use for mixing and mastering in an external DAW. Made this for personal use and decided to publish it in case someone else finds it useful. 

IMPORTANT NOTES:
1. I won't be developing this script further with new features or updates
2. This script was tested using Linux with Blender 3.6 (Flatpak) only. So it may or may not work with your setup.
3. If you want to edit the script further for whatever reason, I just ask that you notify me so I can use it too
4. I'll upload instructions and screenshots for the addon when I get the chance. For now, to use the addon, go to the new tab called "Export" in the side panel of the Sequencer window of the VSE.
